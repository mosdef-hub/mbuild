mBuild
=======
*A hierarchical, component based molecule builder*

With just a few lines of mBuild code, you can assemble reusable components into
complex molecular systems for molecular simulations.


* mBuild is designed to minimize or even eliminate the need to explicitly translate and
  orient components when building systems: you simply tell it to connect two
  pieces!
* mBuild keeps track of the system's topology so you don't have to
  worry about manually defining bonds when constructing chemically bonded
  structures from smaller components.


Example system
---------------

Components in dashed boxes are drawn by hand using, e.g.,
`Avogadro <http://avogadro.cc>`_ or generated elsewhere. Each
component is wrapped as a simple python class with user defined attachment
sites, or ports. That's the hard part! Now mBuild can do the rest. Each component
further down the hierarchy is, again, a simple python class that describes
which piece should connect to which piece.

Ultimately, complex systems structures can be created with just a line or two
of code. Additionally, this approach seamlessly exposes tunable parameters within
the hierarchy so you can actually create whole families of structures simply
by adjusting a variable::

    pattern = Random2DPattern(20)  # A random arrangement of 20 pieces on a 2D surface.
    brush_layer = BrushLayer(chain_lenth=20, pattern=pattern, tile_x=3, tile_y=2)
