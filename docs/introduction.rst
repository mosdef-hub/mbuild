The **mBuild** software, in conjunction with the other `Molecular Simulation Design Framework (MoSDeF) <https://mosdef.org>`_ tools, supports a wide range of 
simulation engines, including `Cassandra <https://cassandra.nd.edu>`_, `GPU Optimized Monte Carlo (GOMC) <http://gomc.eng.wayne.edu>`_, `GROMACS <https://www.gromacs.org>`_,  
`HOOMD-blue <http://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/>`_, and 
`Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) <https://lammps.sandia.gov>`_.  
The **mBuild** and **MoSDeF** tools allow simulation reproducibility 
across the various simulation engines, eliminating the need to be an expert user in all 
the engines to replicate, continue, or advance the existing research. Additionally, 
the software can auto-generate many different systems, 
allowing large-scale screening of chemicals and materials using
`Signac <https://signac.io>`_ to manage the simulations and data.

The `MoSDeF <https://mosdef.org>`_ software is comprised the following packages:
    * `mBuild <https://mbuild.mosdef.org/en/stable/>`_ -- A hierarchical, component based molecule builder
    * `foyer <https://foyer.mosdef.org/en/stable/>`_ -- A package for atom-typing as well as applying and disseminating forcefields
    * `GMSO <https://gmso.mosdef.org/en/stable/>`_ -- Flexible storage of chemical topology for molecular simulation
