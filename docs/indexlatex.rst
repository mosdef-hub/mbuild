**mBuild**: *A hierarchical, component based molecule builder*

With just a few lines of mBuild code, you can assemble reusable components into
complex molecular systems for molecular simulations.


* mBuild is designed to minimize or even eliminate the need to explicitly translate and
  orient components when building systems: you simply tell it to connect two
  pieces!
* mBuild keeps track of the system's topology so you don't have to
  worry about manually defining bonds when constructing chemically bonded
  structures from smaller components.
