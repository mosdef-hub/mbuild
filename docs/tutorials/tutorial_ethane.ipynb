    "As you probably noticed while creating your methane mocule in the last tutorial, manually adding `Particles` and `Bonds` to a `Compound` is a bit cumbersome. The easiest way to create small, reusable components, such as methyls, amines or monomers, is to hand draw them using software like [Avogadro](http://avogadro.cc/wiki/Main_Page) and export them as either a .pdb or .mol2 file (the file should contain connectivity information).\n",

By convention, we try to label `Ports` successively as 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right', 'front', 'back' which should roughly correspond to their relative orientations. This is a bit tricky to enforce because the system is so flexible so use your best judgement and try to be consistent! The more components we collect in our library with the same labeling conventions, the easier it becomes to build ever more complex structures.\n",
