    "Okay, a couple of things to note immediately:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time: the bilayer builder has to make a lot of calculations in order to do its job, so making these systems takes a while. However, this is merely a tutorial, so in the future we'll use molecules with alkyl hydrogens removed, and we'll simulate smaller systems\n",
    "* The `lipids` parameter: that is the single required parameter (for now), and will be the subject of our next discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, let's briefly discuss how these bilayers are constructed:\n",
    "* Lipid placement\n",
    "    * The Bilayer Builder utilizes mBuild's `2DGridPattern` class, which creates a scaffold of positions that the lipids are placed onto. The size of this grid is controlled by the user.\n",
    "* Solvation\n",
    "    * Lipid bilayers do not exist in a vacuum; therefore, the Bilayer Builder has built-in capability to solvate the bilayer in water, which the user can control\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bilayer Builder's strength is the control it gives to the user in determining physical properties of their specific lipid bilayer system. Therefore, there are numerous parameters which the Bilayer Builder requires (most are set to intelligent default values, and you would do good to minimize altering those defaults; however, this tutorial will explain how to control those variables). Let's begin with how to specify your desired composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lesson 2: Controlling the Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "*Parameters*:\n",
    "1. `lipids`: This parameter specifies the composition of your bilayer, as well as a number of other lipid-specific parameters. This is the most involved parameter, and therefore merits more discussion\n",
    "    * Data Type: `list of tuples`, where each tuple represents a single lipid molecule\n",
    "    * Each tuple has four elements that must be given in this order:\n",
    "        * The lipid itself; an `mb.Compound`\n",
    "        * The fraction of the bilayer made up of that lipid; type `float`, must be between 0 and 1\n",
    "        * Headgroup Offset: some lipid head groups tend to sink deeper into the bilayer when simulated alongside a phospholipid, so the Bilayer Builder tries to accomodate this by adjusting their starting position with respect to the bilayer normal with this variable (distance in nanometers)\n",
    "            * Data Type: float; greater than zero moves the lipid \"up\" (into the solvent), less than zero move the lipid deeper into the bilayer\n",
    "        * Reference atom: Each lipid is an mBuild `Compound`, and therefore is made up of `Particles`, all of which have an integer index. The reference atom is the atom which the user considers to be the top of the \"head group\" of the lipid.\n",
    "            * This atom will form the bilayer-solvent interface; it is therefore necessary that the user know the components of any lipid they input into the Bilayer Builder\n",
