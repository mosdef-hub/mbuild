    "In this example, we'll cover assembling more complex hierarchies of components using patterns, tiling and how to output systems to files. To illustrate these concepts, let's build an alkane monolayer on a crystalline substrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's build our monomers and functionalized them with a silane group which we can then attach to the substrate. The `Alkane` example uses the `polymer` tool to combine `CH2` and `CH3` repeat units. You also have the option to cap the front and back of the chain or to leave a `CH2` group with a dangling port. The `Silane` compound is a Si(OH)<sub>2</sub> group with two ports facing out from the central Si. Lastly, we combine `alkane` with `silane` and add a label to `AlkylSilane` which points to, `silane['down']`. This allows us to reference it later using `AlkylSilane['down']` rather than `AlkylSilane['silane']['down']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__ In `Compounds` with multiple `Ports`, by convention, we try to label every `Port` successively as 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right', 'front', 'back' which should roughly correspond to their relative orientations. This is a bit tricky to enforce because the system is so flexible so use your best judgement and try to be consistent! The more components we collect in our library with the same labeling conventions, the easier it becomes to build ever more complex structures."
