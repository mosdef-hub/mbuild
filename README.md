With just a few lines of mBuild code, you can assemble reusable components into
complex molecular systems for molecular dynamics simulations.

* mBuild is designed to minimize or even eliminate the need to explicitly translate and
  orient components when building systems: you simply tell it to connect two
  pieces!
* mBuild keeps track of the system's topology so you don't have to
  worry about manually defining bonds when constructing chemically bonded
  structures from smaller components.

The `mBuild` package is part of the [Molecular Simulation Design Framework (MoSDeF) project](http://mosdef.org/).
Libraries in the MoSDeF ecosystem are designed to provide utilities neccessary to streamline
a researcher's simulation workflow. When setting up simulation studies,
we also recommend users to follow the [TRUE](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00268976.2020.1742938)
(Transparent, Reproducible, Usable-by-others, and Extensible) standard, which is a set of common
practices meant to improve the reproducibility of computational simulation research.

Installation
------------
For full, detailed instructions, refer to the [documentation for installation](https://mbuild.mosdef.org/en/stable/getting_started/installation/installation_toc.html)

#### `conda` installation quickstart
`mBuild` is available on `conda` and can be installed as:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge mbuild
```

#### Installing from source

Dependencies of mBuild are listed in the files ``environment.yml`` (lightweight environment specification containing minimal dependencies) and ``environment-dev.yml`` (comprehensive environment specification including optional and testing packages for developers).
The ``mbuild`` or ``mbuild-dev`` conda environments can be created with


```.. code-block:: bash
git clone https://github.com/mosdef-hub/mbuild.git
cd mbuild
# for mbuild conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate mbuild

# for mbuild-dev
conda env create -f environment-dev.yml
conda activate mbuild-dev

# install a non-editable version of mbuild
pip install .
```

#### Install an editable version from source

Once all dependencies have been installed and the ``conda`` environment has been created, the ``mBuild`` itself can be installed.

``` code-block:: bash
cd mbuild
conda activate mbuild-dev # or mbuild depending on your installation
pip install -e .
```
#### Quick Start with Docker
To use `mbuild` in a jupyter-notebook that runs from a docker container with all the dependencies installed use the following command:

```sh
$ docker pull mosdef/mbuild:latest
$ docker run -it --name mbuild -p 8888:8888 mosdef/mbuild:latest su anaconda -s\
      /bin/sh -l -c "jupyter-notebook --no-browser --ip="0.0.0.0" --notebook-dir\
      /home/anaconda/mbuild-notebooks
```

Alternatively, you can also start a Bourne shell directly:
```sh
$ docker run -it --name mbuild mosdef/mbuild:latest
```

To learn more about using `mBuild` with docker, please refer to the documentation [here](https://mbuild.mosdef.org/en/latest/docker.html).

Components in dashed boxes are drawn by hand using, e.g.,
[Avogadro](https://avogadro.cc/) or generated elsewhere. Each
component is wrapped as a simple python class with user defined attachment
sites, or ports. That's the "hard" part! Now mBuild can do the rest. Each component
further down the hierarchy is, again, a simple python class that describes
which piece should connect to which piece.

Ultimately, complex structures can be created with just a line or two
of code. Additionally, this approach seamlessly exposes tunable parameters within
the hierarchy so you can actually create whole families of structures simply
by adjusting a variable:

```python
import mbuild as mb
from mbuild.examples import PMPCLayer

pattern = mb.Random2DPattern(20)  # A random arrangement of 20 pieces on a 2D surface.
pmpc_layer = PMPCLayer(chain_length=20, pattern=pattern, tile_x=3, tile_y=2)
```
