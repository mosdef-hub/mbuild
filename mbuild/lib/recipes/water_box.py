class Water3SiteBox(Compound):
    """Generate a box of 3-site water molecules.

    Efficiently create an mbuild Compound containing water at density ~1000 kg/m^3
    where local molecule orientations should exist in relatively low energy states.
    This loads in a configuration previously generated with packmol and relaxed with
    GROMACS via NVT simulation at 305K using tip3p model, simulated in a 4 nm^3 box.
    The code will duplicate/truncate the configuration as necessary to satisify the
    given box dimensions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    box : mb.Box
        The desired box to fill with water
    edge : float or list of floats, default=0.1 (nm)
        Specifies the gutter around the system to avoid overlaps at boundaries
    model : mb.Compound, optional, default=water_models.WaterTIP3P()
        The specified 3-site water model to be used. This uses the force overlap
        command to translate and orient the specified water model to the given coordinates.
        See mbuild/lib/molecules/water.py for available water models or extend the base model.
    mask : mb.Compound, optional, default=None
        Remove water molecules from the final configuration that overlap with the Compound
        specified by the mask. If the element field is set, the sum of the particle radii
        will be used.
    radii_dict : dict, optional, None
        User defined radii values based on the name field of a Compound.  This will supercede
        the built-in elements' radii.
    radii_overlap : float, optional, default=0.15 (nm)
        Default value if the radii_dict or element field are not defined for a particle.
    radii_scaling : float, optional, default=1.0
        Radii are multiplied by this factor during the masking routine. This allows the
        space between the masking particles and the water to be adjusted. This will apply to
        values in radii_dict, radii based on element, and radii_overlap.
