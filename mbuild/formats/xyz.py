    The expected format is as follows:
    The first line contains the number of atoms in the file. The second line
    contains a comment, which is not read. Remaining lines, one for each
    atom in the file, include an elemental symbol followed by X, Y, and Z
    coordinates in Angstroms. Columns are expected tbe separated by
    whitespace. See https://openbabel.org/wiki/XYZ_(format).

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str
        Path of the input file

    Returns
    -------

    Notes
    -----
    The XYZ file format neglects many important details, including bonds,
    residues, and box information.

    There are some other flavors of the XYZ file format and not all are
    guaranteed to be compatible with this reader. For example, the TINKER
    XYZ format is not expected to be properly read.
