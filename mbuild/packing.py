    """Fill a box with a `mbuild.compound` or `Compound`s using PACKMOL.

   `fill_box` takes a single `mbuild.Compound` or a
   list of `mbuild.Compound`'s and return an `mbuild.Compound` that has
   been filled to the user's specifications to the best of PACKMOL's ability.

    When filling a system, two arguments of `n_compounds, box, and density`
    must be specified.

    If `n_compounds` and `box` are not None, the specified number of
    n_compounds will be inserted into a box of the specified size.

    If `n_compounds` and `density` are not None, the corresponding box
    size will be calculated internally. In this case, `n_compounds`
    must be an int and not a list of int.

    If `box` and `density` are not None, the corresponding number of
    compounds will be calculated internally.

    For the cases in which `box` is not specified but generated internally,
    the default behavior is to calculate a cubic box. Optionally,
    `aspect_ratio` can be passed to generate a non-cubic box.

    Parameters
    ----------
    compound : mb.Compound or list of mb.Compound
        Compound or list of compounds to fill in box.
    n_compounds : int or list of int
        Number of compounds to be filled in box.
    box : mb.Box
        Box to be filled by compounds.
    density : float, units kg/m^3, default=None
        Target density for the system in macroscale units. If not None, one of
        `n_compounds` or `box`, but not both, must be specified.
    overlap : float, units nm, default=0.2
        Minimum separation between atoms of different molecules.
    seed : int, default=12345
        Random seed to be passed to PACKMOL.
    edge : float, units nm, default=0.2
        Buffer at the edge of the box to not place molecules. This is necessary
        in some systems because PACKMOL does not account for periodic boundary
        conditions in its optimization.
    compound_ratio : list, default=None
        Ratio of number of each compound to be put in box. Only used in the
        case of `density` and `box` having been specified, `n_compounds` not
        specified, and more than one `compound`.
    aspect_ratio : list of float
        If a non-cubic box is desired, the ratio of box lengths in the x, y,
        and z directions.
    fix_orientation : bool or list of bools
        Specify that compounds should not be rotated when filling the box,
        default=False.
    temp_file : str, default=None
        File name to write PACKMOL's raw output to.
    update_port_locations : bool, default=False
        After packing, port locations can be updated, but since compounds
        can be rotated, port orientation may be incorrect.

    Returns
    -------

        Compound to solvate the box.
    n_solvent : int
        Number of solvents to be put in box.
    box : mb.Box
        Box to be filled by compounds.
    overlap : float, units nm, default=0.2
        Minimum separation between atoms of different molecules.
    seed : int, default=12345
        Random seed to be passed to PACKMOL.
    edge : float, units nm, default=0.2
        Buffer at the edge of the box to not place molecules. This is necessary
        in some systems because PACKMOL does not account for periodic boundary
        conditions in its optimization.
    fix_orientation : bool
        Specify if solvent should not be rotated when filling box,

    temp_file : str, default=None
        File name to write PACKMOL's raw output to.
    update_port_locations : bool, default=False
        After packing, port locations can be updated, but since compounds
        can be rotated, port orientation may be incorrect.
